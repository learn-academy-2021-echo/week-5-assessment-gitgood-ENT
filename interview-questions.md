# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block is any section of code that is inside of something that has an `end`. Like a `def`, an `if`, any methods with an end.

  Researched answer: Blocks are anonymous functions that are called on using the do...end syntax or using {} for single line blocks. Block arguments should be defined between the | | (pipe characters). Block can use the yield return and it will expect the Block to be passed into it as an argument at this time or it will give an error of `no block given`



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: a gem is a package for ruby, that i believe is similar to node modules from javascript and can contain anything from testing frameworks to stylizing packages.

  Researched answer: Ruby Gems are ruby software packages, and they contain a packaged ruby application or library. They can be used to modify functionality in applications or distribute reuasble functionality with others for their own use. Gems each have a name, version, and platform. PLatforms are based on CPU architecture, OS type, and occasionally system version. Gems all contain Code, Documentation, and the gemspec. The gemspec contains a lot of the information about the gem itsself including but not limited to the author's name and email. Rails is an example of a gem.



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a framework built inside a ruby gem that provides a scalable framework with base functionality built into the gem itsself.

  Researched answer: Rails is a server side web app framework  written in ruby. It provides default structures for a database, webservice, and web pages. It facilitates the use of web standards like JSON and XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JS for UI. It emphasizes use of convention over configuration, DRY, and the active record pattern. 



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is one that uses unique keys for each of its values and uses that relationship to call on the value. probably

  Researched answer: Each row in the table is a record with a unique key. The comlumns of the table hold attribute of the data and each record usually has a value for each attribute making it easy to establish the attributes relationships. 


  A - atomicity defines all the elements that make up a complete database transaction.
  C - consistency defines the rules for maintaining data points in a correct state after a transaction 
  I - Isolation keeps the effect of a transaction invisible to others until it is completed, to avoid confusion
  D - Durability ensures that data changes become permanent once the transaction is committed

  There are non relational databases, NoSQL.
  Document data store
  column-oriented database
  key-value store and graph db
  and graph db 



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are the unique keys that are in the database that the value is in, and foreign keys are those keys stored in other databases. They are important becuase they are the location of the values within the database.

  Researched answer: A primary key is used as a unique identifier for a column or groups of columns and helps to quickly parse data within the table. Without primary keys relational databases wouldn't work. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: REpresentational State Transfer provides a consistent pattern to use in structuring routes. It provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions. a RESTful route uses the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON: JS Object Notation is a data interchange format. It is easy to read and write, and parse and generate.
